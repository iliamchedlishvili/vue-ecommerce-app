#
    Git Always works with local copies and remote copies of branches.

    local copies of breanches are 
    main
    feature/my-branch

    remote branches are
    origin/main
    origin/feature/my-branch

    branch naming practices
    feature/new-branch-name   new features
    bugfix/new-branch-name    fixing bugs

#

# Simple Flow Without Branches
git add .                   # this command stages files to commit
git status                  # check status modified files 
git commit -m 'comment'     # saves only staged changes to repository locally
git push                    # send commits to the remote repository
git fetch                   # Downloads but not merges automatically. do not change your local branch. you must merge manually git merge origin/main
                            # use fetch when you want to see what's changed before merging
git pull                    # Downloads + merges automatically. it is two command in one git fetch and git merge

# With Branches

# 1) Start from latest main
git checkout main                     # switch to main
git pull                              # get latest changes from remote

# 2) Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-branch # create & switch to feature branch
git checkout feature/my-new-branch  # if already exists

# 3) Do your work, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "comment"

# 4) Push feature branch (first time)
git push -u origin feature/my-new-branch
# Next times you can just: git push

# 5) Go back to main and update it
git checkout main
git pull                              # important: main may have new changes

# 6) Merge feature into main (locally)
git merge feature/my-new-branch

# 7) Push updated main to remote
git push

# 8) Optional CleanUp
git branch -d feature/my-new-branch          # delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/my-new-branch   # delete remote branch

# Pull Request Workflow

# Start from the latest main
git checkout main
git pull        # update your local main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-branch

# If the branch already exists locally
git checkout feature/my-new-branch

# Do your work → add & commit
git add .
git commit -m "comment"

#Push feature branch (first time)
git push -u origin feature/my-new-branch
